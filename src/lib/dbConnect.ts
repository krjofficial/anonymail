// db.connections[0]
// db: This variable represents the result of a successful connection to the MongoDB database using Mongoose. Itâ€™s an object that includes information about the connection.
// connections: This is an array of all the connections managed by Mongoose. In most typical cases, you would have a single connection, so db.connections is an array with one element.
// [0]: Since connections is an array, [0] accesses the first (and usually only) connection in this array.
// 2. readyState
// readyState: This property indicates the state of the connection to the MongoDB server. It is a numeric value representing different states of the connection. The possible values are:

// 0: Disconnected
// 1: Connected
// 2: Connecting
// 3: Disconnecting
// readyState provides a way to check the current status of the connection.
